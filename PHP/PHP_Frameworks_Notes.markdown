# PHP Frameworks Notes

## Definition
- **PHP Framework**: A platform providing a structured foundation for developing web applications in PHP, enabling rapid application development (RAD) by minimizing repetitive coding and standardizing processes.
- **Purpose**: Speeds up development, enhances code organization, and ensures adherence to best practices.
- **Framework**: A collection of methods, classes, and files that developers can use and extend to build applications efficiently.

## Why Use a PHP Framework?
- **Faster Development**: Built-in libraries and tools reduce development time.
- **Better Performance**: Frameworks are optimized and tested for performance.
- **Less Code**: Built-in functions reduce the need for original code.
- **Libraries for Common Operations**: Simplifies tasks like validation, data cleaning, and CRUD operations.
- **Best Practices**: Encourages clean, maintainable code and consistent naming conventions.
- **Security**: Offers built-in protections against threats like SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF.
- **Teamwork**: Standardizes project structure, enabling collaborative development.
- **Maintainability**: Creates leaner, more maintainable codebases with core framework maintenance handled by its developers.
