# IT Project Monetization Notes

## 1. Introduction to Project Management

### 1.1 Project
- **Definition**: A temporary endeavor to create a unique product, service, or result with a defined start and end, often constrained by time, funding, or deliverables, aimed at achieving specific goals for beneficial change or added value.
  - Contains unknown elements, creating risk.
  - Outcomes can be tangible (e.g., a product) or intangible (e.g., a process improvement).
  - Simplified definition: A temporary effort to achieve a specific aim.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Response to a need or solution to a problem.
  - Moves from problem to solution through planned activities.
  - Examples: 
    - Launching a new product.
    - Building equipment.
    - Developing software.
    - Running a political campaign.
    - Planning a party or launching a space shuttle.
  - Components:
    - Defined beginning.
    - Multiple planned activities.
    - Defined end.
- **Why Projects Start**:
  - To achieve organizational strategic objectives due to:
    - Market demand.
    - Strategic/business opportunities.
    - Customer requests.
    - Technological advances.
    - Legal requirements.
- **Why Projects End**:
  - Objectives achieved.
  - Objectives cannot/will not be met.
  - Need for project no longer exists.
  - Client terminates the project.

### 1.2 Management
- **Definition**: The ability to organize resources and administer tasks to achieve objectives.

### 1.3 Project Management
- **Definition**: Application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet specific goals and success criteria, delivering results on time and within budget.
- **Purpose**:
  - Ensure effective resource use.
  - Deliver project objectives within time and cost constraints.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - A project is an interrelated set of activities with a definite start/end and a unique outcome.
  - Activities/tasks are the smallest work units, consuming time and resources.
  - A schedule allocates resources, sets priorities, and defines start/finish times.
  - Requires proficient use of hard (technical) and soft (interpersonal) skills to manage internal/external resources.
- **Success Criteria**:
  - Completed on time.
  - Within budget.
  - Meets technical/performance standards satisfying the end user.
- **Project Management Process Groups** (PMBOK Guide, 6th Edition):
  1. **Initiating**:
     - Scope the project.
     - Create project charter.
     - Identify stakeholders.
  2. **Planning**:
     - Develop project plan.
     - Collect requirements.
     - Plan scope, cost, quality, HR, communication, risk, and procurement.
  3. **Executing**:
     - Launch the plan.
     - Manage project work, quality assurance, team development, and procurements.
  4. **Monitoring and Controlling**:
     - Monitor progress, scope, schedule, quality, risks, and procurements.
  5. **Closing**:
     - Close project and procurements.

## 2. Project Constraints
- **Triple Constraints (Trade-off Triangle)**:
  - Cost, Time, Scope: Core constraints with specific targets set at project start.
- **Enhanced Model (Six Constraints)**:
  - PRINCE2 expands to include:
    - **Quality**: Defined by the customer, impacts scope/time/cost.
    - **Risks**: Inherent in all projects, affects outcomes.
    - **Resources**: Availability influences project delivery.
  - All six constraints interlink to control project success.

## 3. Core Components of Project Success
- **People**:
  - Soft skills (e.g., communication, teamwork) to manage human interactions.
- **Process**:
  - Formal/informal methods with defined steps for project management.
- **Technology**:
  - Tools for scheduling, costing, risk management, reporting, or visualization (e.g., software, gadgets).
- **Success Formula**: Combining skilled people, effective processes, and appropriate technology reduces risk, boosts productivity, and improves quality.

## 4. Project Charter
- **Definition**: A document providing key project information, used to gain approval to start the project. It’s an essential deliverable (per PMBOK Guide).
- **Key Components**:
  - **Stakeholders**: Identify their needs, expectations, concerns, and influence.
  - **Project Scope**: Defines project boundaries, detailed in the project plan.
  - **Project Objectives**: SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) outcomes.
  - **Risks**: Potential threats impacting project development.
  - **Project Description**: Brief overview of needs addressed and completion timeline.
  - **Business Case**: Non-quantifiable explanation of project purpose and strategic impact.
  - **Milestones**: Significant achievements or points in the project timeline.
- **Example Template**:
  - Title, description, objectives, scope, stakeholders, risks, milestones, business case.
  - ![Image Example](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-W1Mq0KTq5hA/XBpF5_48LVI/AAAAAAAAB-Y/ZKvNHpseR2g-dCV0DSk-PmspzOkP_0RAACLcBGAs/s16000/Project-Charter-Template.png)
  - ![Image 2 Example](https://www.itsm-docs.com/cdn/shop/products/ProjectCharterTemplate_720x.png)
- **Assignment Idea**:
  - Summarize project charter concepts.
  - Create a charter for an IT project (e.g., “Develop a Mobile Banking App”).
    - Title: Clear, relevant project name.
    - Include all key components.

## 5. Manager vs. Leader
- **Manager**:
  - Focuses on organizing resources, administering tasks, and ensuring efficiency.
  - Qualities: Planning, problem-solving, decision-making, resource allocation.
- **Leader**:
  - Inspires and motivates, focuses on vision and people.
  - Qualities: Visionary, empathetic, communicative, adaptable.
- **Management vs. Leadership**:
  - Management: Doing things right (efficiency, processes).
  - Leadership: Doing the right things (vision, direction).
- **Peter Drucker’s Insight**:
  - “Managers do things right; leaders do the right things.”
  - Managers focus on systems and structure; leaders focus on people and innovation.
- **Key Discussion**:
  - Managers ensure tasks are completed correctly; leaders ensure the right goals are pursued.
  - Both roles are complementary for project success.
