# Vulnerability Assessment

## Summary

This topic covers vulnerability assessment, the process of identifying and evaluating weaknesses in systems, networks, or applications that could be exploited. It includes types, techniques, and classifications of vulnerabilities.

* **Types of Vulnerabilities**: Categories like software, hardware, and human flaws.
* **Assessment Techniques**: Methods and tools for vulnerability identification.
* **Classification**: Based on nature, impact, and exploitability.

## Types of Vulnerabilities

Vulnerabilities are weaknesses that attackers can exploit to compromise systems, categorized by their source.

**Types**:
- **Software**: Bugs or outdated software (e.g., unpatched Windows vulnerabilities).
- **Hardware**: Flaws in physical components (e.g., CPU vulnerabilities like Spectre).
- **Network**: Insecure configurations (e.g., open ports, weak Wi-Fi encryption).
- **Human**: Errors or social engineering (e.g., phishing susceptibility).
- **Physical**: Unsecured hardware access (e.g., unprotected servers).
- **Procedural**: Weak policies (e.g., no password rotation).

**Examples**:
- A software bug allows SQL injection in a web app.
- An unsecured server room enables physical tampering.
- A phishing email tricks an employee into revealing credentials.

A retailer identifies unpatched software and weak Wi-Fi as vulnerabilities, prompting updates and encryption.

## Vulnerability Assessment Techniques

Vulnerability assessment uses automated and manual methods to identify weaknesses, following structured methodologies.

**Techniques**:
- **Automated Scanning**: Tools detect known vulnerabilities (e.g., Nessus, OpenVAS).
- **Manual Penetration Testing**: Simulates attacks to find flaws.
- **Network/Port Scanning**: Identifies open ports/services (e.g., Nmap).
- **Configuration Review**: Checks system settings (e.g., firewall rules).
- **Code Review**: Analyzes source code for flaws (e.g., SQL injection).

**Methodologies**:
- **Black Box**: No system knowledge, like an external attacker.
- **White Box**: Full system access, for in-depth analysis.
- **Gray Box**: Partial knowledge, simulating insider threats.
- **Compliance-Based**: Ensures adherence to standards (e.g., PCI-DSS).

**Examples**:
- Nessus scans a network for outdated software.
- A white box test reviews code for XSS vulnerabilities.
- Tools: Burp Suite, Qualys, Nikto.

A bank uses OpenVAS for automated scans and manual pen testing to ensure PCI-DSS compliance.

## Classification of Vulnerabilities

Vulnerabilities are classified by their nature, impact, and exploitability to prioritize remediation.

**Based on Nature**:
- Software: Code flaws (e.g., buffer overflows).
- Hardware: Design issues (e.g., Meltdown).
- Network: Protocol weaknesses (e.g., unencrypted traffic).
- Human: User errors (e.g., weak passwords).
- Physical: Security gaps (e.g., no locks on server rooms).

**Based on Impact**:
- Critical: Full compromise (e.g., zero-day exploits).
- High: Significant loss (e.g., privilege escalation).
- Medium: Limited damage (e.g., insecure configs).
- Low: Minimal impact (e.g., UI glitches).

**Based on Exploitability**:
- Easily Exploitable: Low skill needed (e.g., public exploits).
- Moderately Exploitable: Specific conditions (e.g., race conditions).
- Difficult: Advanced skills required (e.g., complex attacks).
- Unexploitable: Impractical (e.g., theoretical flaws).

**Examples**:
- A critical, easily exploitable zero-day in Apache requires immediate patching.
- A low-impact UI glitch is deprioritized.
- Tools: CVSS scoring, NIST NVD.

A company prioritizes a critical network vulnerability over a low-impact software glitch, using CVSS scores.
