# Chapter 1: Introduction to C Programming Language

## Overview of C
- **Origin**: Developed in 1972 at AT&T Bell Laboratories, USA, by Dennis Ritchie.
- **Purpose**: Designed for programming the UNIX operating system.
- **Evolution**: 
  - Replaced languages like PL/I and ALGOL in the late 1970s.
  - ANSI C standard established in the early 1980s, with compiler adoption taking years.
- **Current Use**:
  - Major parts of operating systems (Windows, UNIX, Linux) are written in C.
  - Used for device driver programs to extend OS functionality for new devices.
- **Popularity**: Reliable, simple, easy to use; excels in performance (speed of execution).
- **Comparison**: Compared to C++, C#, and Java, but remains relevant for performance-critical applications.

## Program Structure
- **Analogy to Language Learning**:
  - Similar to learning English: start with alphabets, form words, then sentences, and paragraphs.
  - In C: learn alphabets, numbers, special symbols, then constants, variables, keywords to form instructions, which combine into a program.
- **Definition**: A computer program is a collection of instructions to solve a specific problem when executed.
- **Instruction Set**: Basic operations of a computer system.
- **Algorithm**: Method or approach to solve a problem.
- **Types of Languages**:
  - **High-Level**: Human-readable, portable (e.g., C, Python, Java).
  - **Low-Level**: Hardware-specific (e.g., machine code, assembly language).

## Programming Languages
- **Definition**: A formal language with instructions to produce outputs, used to implement algorithms.
- **Categories**:
  - **Low-Level Languages**:
    - **Machine Language**: Uses binary (0s and 1s), error-prone, non-portable.
    - **Assembly Language**: Uses mnemonics (e.g., ADD, MOV), hardware-specific, requires an assembler.
    - **Characteristics**: Not portable, requires hardware knowledge, stores data in registers.
  - **High-Level Languages**:
    - Examples: Pascal, Cobol, Fortran, C, Python, Java.
    - **Characteristics**: Machine-independent, portable, requires translation via compiler or interpreter.
    - **Translation Process**:
      - **Source Program**: High-level language code.
      - **Object Program**: Machine-level code after translation.

## Translators
- **Definition**: Software that converts high-level or low-level code into machine code.
- **Types**:
  - **Compiler**: Translates entire program into object code, lists all errors, faster execution, preferred for large programs.
  - **Interpreter**: Translates and executes one line at a time, checks errors per statement, slower execution.
  - **Assembler**: Translates assembly language (mnemonics like LOAD, STORE, ADD) into machine code, one instruction per machine code.

## Compiler vs. Interpreter
| Aspect                     | Compiler                                                            | Interpreter                                                         |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Translation                | Translates entire program into executable object code.             | Translates and executes one line at a time.                        |
| Execution Speed            | Faster, as code is in machine language.                            | Slower, as each line is translated before execution.               |
| User Requirements          | No compiler needed on userâ€™s system.                               | Requires interpreter; source code is visible.                      |
| Source Code Visibility     | Hidden in distributed programs.                                    | Visible and copyable by users.                                     |
| Use Case                   | Frequent-run software or sold to third parties.                    | Program development or multi-platform software.                    |

## Low-Level vs. High-Level Languages
| Type                | Examples                              | Description                                                                | Example Instructions                     |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| High-Level Language | Pascal, Cobol, Fortran, C, Python, Java | Portable, translated by compiler/interpreter, one statement = multiple instructions. | `payRate = 10000; hours = 33.5; salary = payRate * hours;` |
| Low-Level Language  | Assembly Language                     | Hardware-specific, translated by assembler, one statement = one instruction. | `LDA181 ADD93 STO185`                   |
| Machine Code        | Binary code                           | Executable code from compiler, interpreter, or assembler.                  | `110100101010000011101010 00101101`    |

## Advantages of Programming Languages

  - **Specialized Languages**:
    - **SQL**: For database management.
    - **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: For web development.
- **Low-Level Languages**:

  - **Efficiency**: Efficient code for specific processors, less memory, faster execution.
  - **Applications**: Used in embedded systems (e.g., washing machines, traffic lights, robots).

## Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
- **Definition**: Software for managing large projects, with features for editing, compiling, linking, running, and debugging.

- Learning C involves mastering its building blocks (alphabets, numbers, symbols) to form instructions and programs.
- Translators (compilers, interpreters, assemblers) convert code to machine-executable form.
- High-level languages prioritize portability; low-level languages offer hardware control and efficiency.
- IDEs enhance productivity with comprehensive development tools.
