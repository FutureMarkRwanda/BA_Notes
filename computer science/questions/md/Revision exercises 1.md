99. **Evaluate the advantages of Java's multithreading feature in modern applications.**  

100. **Write a Java program to demonstrate inheritance by creating a base class Vehicle with derived classes Car and Bike. Include attributes and methods for each class.**  

101. **What is the primary purpose of the 'this' keyword in Java?**  
     a) To refer to static variables  
     b) To refer to the current object  
     c) To define abstract methods  
     d) To invoke parent class constructors  

102. **What type of inheritance does Java not support through classes?**  
     a) Single  
     b) Hierarchical  
     c) Multiple  
     d) Multilevel  

103. **What is the difference between default and parameterized constructors?**  
     a) Default constructors initialize objects with parameters, while parameterized constructors do not.

103. **(continued)**  
     b) Parameterized constructors require arguments, while default constructors do not.  
     c) Default constructors are defined by the programmer, while parameterized constructors are provided by the compiler.  
     d) Default constructors do not exist in Java.  

104. **What happens if a constructor is declared private?**  
     a) The class can be instantiated normally.  
     b) The class cannot be extended.  
     c) Objects of the class cannot be created from outside the class.  
     d) The class behaves like an abstract class.  

105. **Write a Java program to demonstrate the use of a default constructor and a parameterized constructor in a class called Person. The default constructor will assign the initial values "Unknown" and 0 to instance variables name and age respectively, while the parameterized constructor will assign the values received as arguments from the main to the instance variables. The class Person also includes a method displayInfo to print the information.**  

106. **Write a Java program to demonstrate the use of the `this` keyword for distinguishing local variables and instance variables in a class called Student.**  

107. **Compare the use of constructors and methods in Java. Highlight at least three key differences.**  

108. **Examine the implications of method overriding in Java. Discuss its advantages and limitations.**  

109. **Evaluate the importance of abstraction in designing Java applications.**  

110. **Design a Java program to demonstrate hierarchical inheritance where a base class Animal has a method call(), and two derived classes Dog and Cat inherit from it. The Dog class should have a method bark(), and the Cat class should have a method meow(). Include a main method to instantiate objects of Dog and Cat classes, invoke the inherited method call() from the Animal class, and call their respective unique methods bark() and meow(). Write the full code implementation.**  

111. **What does the term "stream" refer to in Java IO?**  
     a) A sequence of operations  
     b) A sequence of data values from an input source or output destination  
     c) A method to handle exceptions  
     d) A Java thread for background processes

112. **Which of the following methods is used to read a line of text in BufferedReader?**  
     a) readLine()  
     b) nextLine()  
     c) read()  
     d) next()  

113. **Why is the Scanner class preferred for reading user input?**  
     a) It provides synchronized methods.  
     b) It offers convenient methods for parsing primitive types and strings.  
     c) It directly connects to file streams.  
     d) It is faster than other input methods.  

114. **How does the DataInputStream differ from BufferedReader?**  
     a) DataInputStream reads byte-based data, while BufferedReader reads character-based data.  
     b) DataInputStream supports string parsing, while BufferedReader does not.  
     c) BufferedReader is faster for binary data, while DataInputStream is better for text.  
     d) Both serve the same purpose and are interchangeable.  

115. **Write a Java program using Scanner to read an integer and a double from the user and display them.**  

116. **Write a Java program to copy content from one file to another using FileInputStream and FileOutputStream.**  

117. **Write a program to demonstrate reading a line of text from the console using BufferedReader.**  

118. **Compare the advantages and disadvantages of Scanner, BufferedReader, and DataInputStream.**  

119. **Critique the effectiveness of Java IO Streams for modern application development. Focus on their strengths and weaknesses.**  

120. **Design a Java program to append text to an existing file using FileWriter.**
