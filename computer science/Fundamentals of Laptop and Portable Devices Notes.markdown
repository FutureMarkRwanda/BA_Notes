| **Portability**        | Highly portable, battery-powered           | Stationary, requires constant power         |
| **CPU**                | Mobile processors (e.g., Intel Core i7)    | Desktop processors (often more powerful)    |
| **Cooling**            | Limited cooling (fans, heat sinks)         | Advanced cooling (large fans, liquid cooling) |
| **RAM**                | Soldered or limited slots (4-32GB)         | Multiple slots, higher capacity (up to 128GB) |
| **Storage**            | SSD or small HDD (256GB-1TB)               | Larger HDD/SSD options (1TB+)              |
| **Graphics**           | Integrated or low-power GPUs               | High-performance GPUs possible              |
| **Upgradeability**     | Limited (RAM, storage in some models)      | Highly upgradeable (CPU, GPU, RAM, etc.)   |
| **Power Supply**       | Built-in battery and adapter               | External power supply, no battery           |
| **Cost**               | Higher cost for similar specs              | More cost-effective for performance         |

- **Key Differences**:
  - Laptops prioritize portability and power efficiency, often at the cost of performance.
  - Desktops offer better performance, upgradeability, and cooling but lack mobility.
