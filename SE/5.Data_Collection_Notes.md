# Data Collection Notes

## Overview

Data collection is the systematic process of gathering relevant information to solve problems or inform decision-making in software engineering. It supports critical phases such as planning, requirements analysis, and feasibility assessment by providing factual insights into user behavior, system performance, or market trends.

---

## What is Data?

**Data** are raw facts or observations used for analysis and decision-making. Data can be:

* **Quantitative**: Measurable and numeric (e.g., website load time, sales figures).
* **Qualitative**: Descriptive and categorical (e.g., user feedback, color preferences).

**Example**:
An Online Fashion Store (OFS) might collect:

* **Quantitative data**: Daily sales figures, number of users per hour.
* **Qualitative data**: Customer opinions on website design.

---

## Role in Software Engineering

Data collection informs the Software Requirements Specification (SRS), supports feasibility evaluations, and validates assumptions during development.

**Examples**:

* Interviewing OFS users to identify desired features.
* Analyzing order delays to justify automation.

## Objectives of Data Collection

* Identify and solve project-specific problems.
* Validate stakeholder requirements and system goals.
* Ensure informed decision-making based on real data.

### Key Decisions

* **What to collect**: Performance metrics, user needs, costs, etc.
* **How to collect**: Interviews, surveys, observations.
* **Who collects**: Developers, analysts, or trained enumerators.
* **When to collect**: At key stages of the project lifecycle.

## Types of Data

| Type      | Description                                     | Example                                       |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Primary   | Firsthand, original data for a specific purpose | Surveying OFS users on payment preferences    |
| Secondary | Previously collected data used in new context   | Reviewing market trends from industry reports |

### Comparison

| Feature       | Primary Data                 | Secondary Data                 |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Source        | Collected directly           | Existing sources               |
| Cost & Time   | Expensive and time-consuming | Cheaper and faster             |
| Customization | Fully tailored               | May lack specificity           |
| Reliability   | High (if well collected)     | Depends on original collection |

## Primary Data Collection Methods

### Observation

* **Definition**: Watching behaviors or processes without interference.
* **Types**:

  * Structured vs. Unstructured
  * Participant vs. Non-participant
  * Controlled vs. Uncontrolled
* **Pros**: Real-time insights, cost-effective.
* **Cons**: Subjective, limited detail.
* **Example**: Watching how OFS staff handle returns.

---

### Survey

* **Definition**: Questioning a large sample using a consistent format.
* **Methods**: Online forms, in-person, phone, email.
* **Pros**: Standardized, broad reach.
* **Cons**: Requires honest responses.
* **Example**: Emailing a survey to OFS customers about app usability.

---

### Interview

* **Definition**: Direct one-on-one or group questioning.
* **Types**: Structured, unstructured, group, clinical, etc.
* **Pros**: Deep insights, personal connection.
* **Cons**: Time-intensive, potential bias.
* **Example**: Discussing pain points with OFS store managers.

---

### Questionnaire

* **Definition**: A written list of questions answered by respondents.
* **Types**:

  * **Open-ended**: Free-form responses.
  * **Closed-ended**: Predefined options.
* **Pros**: Low cost, scalable.
* **Cons**: Delayed or unclear responses.
* **Example**: Google Form sent to OFS customers for feature ratings.

---

### Schedule

* **Definition**: Enumerator-administered questionnaire.
* **Pros**: Accurate, reduces non-response.
* **Cons**: Requires trained staff, higher cost.
* **Example**: Field agents interviewing warehouse staff.

---

## Secondary Data Collection Methods

### Internal Sources

* Sales records, CRM data, feedback forms.
* **Example**: OFS sales performance data.

### External Sources

* Government publications, research journals, internet.
* **Example**: Global e-commerce behavior reports.

### Evaluation Criteria

| Factor      | Description                               |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Reliability | Check the source and method of collection |
| Suitability | Ensure relevance to current goals         |
| Adequacy    | Confirm coverage and detail               |
| Accuracy    | Verify correctness and update frequency   |

---

## Sampling in Data Collection

Sampling reduces the need to collect data from the entire population.

### Stratified Sampling

* **Definition**: Divide population into subgroups (strata) and sample proportionally.
* **Formula**:
  **Ni = n × Pi**
  Where:

  * Ni = elements in stratum i
  * n = total sample size
  * Pi = proportion of stratum i (Ni/N)

### Example:

| Stratum   | Size (Ni) | Proportion (Pi) | Sample (Ni = n × Pi) |
| --------- | --------- | --------------- | -------------------- |
| Customers | 6,000     | 0.5             | 15                   |
| Staff     | 3,600     | 0.3             | 9                    |
| Managers  | 2,400     | 0.2             | 6                    |
| **Total** | 12,000    | 1.0             | 30                   |
