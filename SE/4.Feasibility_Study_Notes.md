## Introduction to Feasibility Study

A feasibility study evaluates whether a proposed software solution is practical and valuable. It helps determine whether a project should proceed, by examining technical, economic, operational, and scheduling factors.

### What Is a Feasibility Study?

A feasibility study investigates:

* **Is it possible?** — Can the system be developed with the available resources, skills, and technology?
* **Is it justified?** — Will it add sufficient value or benefits to the organization?
* **Are there alternatives?** — Are there other viable solutions, including keeping the current system?

### Objectives

* Evaluate if the system is feasible.
* Identify viable alternative solutions.
* Support informed decision-making for project approval.
* Ensure alignment with organizational goals and strategy.

### Role in Software Engineering

* Conducted in the **planning** and **requirements gathering** stages of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
* Provides foundational input for the Software Requirements Specification (SRS).
* Supports selecting appropriate development models (Agile, Waterfall, etc.).

## Types of Feasibility

### Technical Feasibility

Evaluates if the system can be developed with the current technology and human resources.

**Key considerations:**

* Is the required technology available?
* Is the team skilled or trainable in the necessary tools?
* Are hardware and software compatible with existing systems?

**Example:** For an online store, assess compatibility with payment APIs and whether developers are proficient in web technologies like React or Node.js.


### Operational Feasibility

Determines whether the system will be accepted and used by stakeholders and users.

**Key considerations:**

* Will users adopt the system?
* Are there policy or workflow conflicts?
* Do any legal, ethical, or cultural issues exist?

**Example:** For a hospital inventory system, evaluate whether the staff is willing to replace paper-based tracking with digital forms.


### Economic Feasibility

Analyzes whether the project is financially justifiable.

**Costs:**

* One-time costs: development, training, equipment.
* Recurring costs: maintenance, hosting, staff.

**Benefits:**

* Tangible: cost savings, increased revenue.
* Intangible: improved decision-making, user satisfaction.

**Evaluation techniques:**

* Net Present Value (NPV)
* Return on Investment (ROI)
* Payback Period (PBP)
* Profitability Index (PI)
* Internal Rate of Return (IRR)


### Schedule Feasibility

Determines whether the system can be delivered on time.

**Key considerations:**

* Are timelines realistic given available resources?
* Are there hard deadlines that must be met?
* What are the risks of delays?

## Economic Feasibility in Detail

### Cost-Benefit Analysis

**Development Costs:**

* Hardware/software acquisition
* Design, implementation, and testing
* Training and documentation

**Operational Costs:**

* Hosting, upgrades, salaries
* Technical support and maintenance

**Tangible Benefits:**

* Increased sales or profit
* Reduced labor or operation costs

**Intangible Benefits:**

* Customer satisfaction
* Faster response and decision-making


### Key Financial Metrics

**Net Present Value (NPV):**

$$
NPV = \sum_{t=0}^{n} \frac{B_t - C_t}{(1 + r)^t}
$$

Where:

* $B_t$: Benefit at year $t$
* $C_t$: Cost at year $t$
* $r$: Discount rate (e.g., 12%)

**Decision Rule:** Accept if NPV > 0.

---

**Return on Investment (ROI):**

$$
ROI = \left( \frac{Total\ Benefits - Total\ Costs}{Total\ Costs} \right) \times 100
$$

**Decision Rule:** Higher ROI indicates better return.

---

**Payback Period (PBP):**

$$
PBP = Years\ before\ recovery + \left( \frac{Remaining\ Cost}{Net\ Benefit\ in\ Recovery\ Year} \right)
$$

**Decision Rule:** Lower PBP is preferred.

---

**Profitability Index (PI):**

$$
PI = \frac{Present\ Value\ of\ Benefits}{Present\ Value\ of\ Costs}
$$

**Decision Rule:** Accept if PI ≥ 1.

---

**Internal Rate of Return (IRR):**

Discount rate at which NPV = 0. Computed via trial or financial software.

**Decision Rule:** Accept if IRR > required return rate.

| Present Values (Benefits) | –       | 80,370  | 71,758  | 71,148  | 62,370      |
| Cumulative Benefits       | –       | 80,370  | 152,128 | 223,276 | 285,646     |
| Net Present Value (NPV)   |         |         |         |         | **-15,571** |

**Conclusion:** Negative NPV means the project is financially unviable under current conditions.

## Best Practices for Feasibility Studies

* Involve all relevant stakeholders early.
* Address resistance through awareness and training.
* Use PIECES framework to identify operational issues.
* Document clearly with structured reports and financial evidence.
* Use version control tools (e.g., Git) for maintaining revisions.

---

## Additional Considerations

**Security Feasibility:**

* Evaluate encryption, authentication, and fraud prevention.
* Ensure compliance with security standards and user expectations.

**Legal Feasibility:**

* Consider regulations (e.g., data protection laws like GDPR).

**Cultural/Political Feasibility:**

* Assess system acceptability across different groups or regions.
