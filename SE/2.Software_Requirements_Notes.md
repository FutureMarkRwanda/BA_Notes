# Software Requirements Notes

# Introduction to Software Requirements

## Summary
Software requirements define the features, functionalities, and constraints of a software system, capturing user and stakeholder expectations to guide development. They are a critical foundation for creating an effective Software Requirements Specification (SRS) within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

## What Are Software Requirements?
Software requirements describe the features and functionalities a software system must deliver to meet user needs. They include:
- **Obvious Requirements**: Clear expectations (e.g., an e-commerce app must have a shopping cart).
- **Hidden Requirements**: Implicit needs (e.g., fast load times for a seamless user experience).
- **Known/Unknown**: Requirements clients explicitly state or are unaware of until elicited.
- **Expected/Unexpected**: Features users assume or discover during development.

For example, an Instagram-like app’s requirements might include posting photos (obvious) and secure data storage (hidden).

## Users vs. Stakeholders
- **System Users**: Individuals who directly interact with the software (e.g., customers browsing an online store, administrators managing product catalogs).
- **Stakeholders**: Anyone with an interest in the project, including users, clients, developers, testers, and managers. For instance, in an e-commerce project, stakeholders include the client (business owner), end-users (shoppers), and the development team.

## Role in Software Engineering
Requirements are gathered and documented during the SDLC’s requirements engineering phase, ensuring the software product (code, libraries, documentation) aligns with user needs. As Fritz Bauer defines, software engineering uses scientific principles to create reliable, efficient software, and requirements are the starting point for this process.

# Requirement Engineering Process

## Summary
Requirement engineering is a structured process to gather, analyze, document, and validate software requirements, producing a comprehensive SRS document.

## Four-Step Process
1. **Feasibility Study**: Assesses if the software is viable to develop.
2. **Requirement Gathering**: Collects user and stakeholder expectations.
3. **Software Requirement Specification (SRS)**: Documents requirements in a structured format.
4. **Software Requirement Validation**: Ensures requirements are practical and clear.

## Feasibility Study
**Purpose**: Evaluates if the proposed software can be developed based on the client’s rough idea of desired functions and features.

**Focus Areas**:
  - **Organizational Goals**: Aligns with business objectives (e.g., increasing sales for an e-commerce platform).
  - **Technical Feasibility**: Checks if technology supports requirements (e.g., integrating a payment gateway).
  - **Cost Constraints**: Assesses budget viability.
  - **Usability, Maintainability, Integration**: Ensures the software is user-friendly, maintainable, and compatible with existing systems.

> **Output**: A feasibility study report with recommendations on whether to proceed. For example, a report for an online fashion store might confirm that a web-based platform is feasible within budget.

## Requirement Gathering
**Process**: Analysts and engineers collaborate with clients and end-users to identify expectations and features. For instance, for an online store, users might request a search feature with filters for size and color.

**Methods**: Includes interviews, surveys, questionnaires, task analysis, domain analysis, brainstorming, prototyping, and observation (detailed below).~~

## Software Requirement Specification (SRS)
**Purpose**: A document created by the system analyst to define how the software interacts with hardware, interfaces, and users, covering:
  - Speed of operation (e.g., <5-second response time).
  - Portability (e.g., runs on web and mobile).
  - Maintainability, security, quality, and limitations.

**Content**:
  - **User Requirements**: Written in natural language (e.g., “users can search products by category”).
  - **Technical Requirements**: Structured language for developers (e.g., database schema for product data).
  - **Design Descriptions**: Pseudo-code, data-flow diagrams (DFDs), GUI mockups.

>**Example**: An SRS for an Instagram-like app specifies posting photos, secure login, and a responsive UI.

## Software Requirement Validation
**Purpose**: Ensures requirements are practical, valid, and free of errors to avoid costly rework.

**Validation Criteria**:
  - **Practical Implementation**: Can the requirement be built? (e.g., a payment system integration).
  - **Functional Validity**: Aligns with software goals (e.g., supports online shopping).
  - **No Ambiguities**: Clear and specific (e.g., “search returns results in <5 seconds” vs. “fast search”).
  - **Completeness**: Covers all needs (e.g., includes all user roles).
  - **Demonstrable**: Can be tested (e.g., test cases for login functionality).

>**Example**: Validating an SRS for an e-commerce app ensures the payment feature supports multiple methods and is secure.

# Requirement Elicitation Techniques

## Summary
Requirement elicitation involves discovering software requirements through various techniques, ensuring all stakeholder needs are captured accurately.

## Elicitation Process
**Requirements Gathering**: Developers discuss expectations with clients and users (e.g., what features an online store should have).

**Organizing Requirements**: Prioritize and categorize requirements by importance and urgency.

**Negotiation & Discussion**: Resolve ambiguities or conflicts among stakeholders (e.g., compromising on feature priorities).

**Documentation**: Record all requirements for the SRS, including functional and non-functional aspects.

## Techniques
1. **Interviews**:
   - **Structured (Closed)**: Predefined questions (e.g., asking users about desired e-commerce features).
   - **Unstructured (Open)**: Flexible discussions to uncover hidden needs.
   - **Types**: Oral, written, one-to-one, or group interviews to gather diverse perspectives.
   - **Example**: Interviewing shoppers to identify preferred payment methods.
2. **Surveys**: Collect feedback from stakeholders via questionnaires (e.g., surveying users on app usability preferences).
3. **Questionnaires**: Predefined questions with options to compile stakeholder expectations (e.g., options for preferred search filters).
4. **Task Analysis**: Study existing processes to identify needs (e.g., analyzing a manual inventory system to design an automated one).
5. **Domain Analysis**: Leverage domain experts to define requirements (e.g., consulting fashion industry experts for an online store).
6. **Brainstorming**: Informal discussions among stakeholders to generate ideas (e.g., brainstorming new features like a “favorites” list).
7. **Prototyping**: Create mockups to gather feedback (e.g., a prototype of an e-commerce UI to test navigation).
8. **Observation**: Observe client workflows to identify needs (e.g., watching how employees process orders in a store).

# Characteristics of Good Software Requirements

**Process Metrics**: Evaluate SDLC methods, tools, and performance (e.g., time spent in requirement gathering).

**Quality Metrics**: Track defects and their impact (e.g., number of bugs found during testing or post-deployment).

**Resource Metrics**: Measure effort, time, and resources (e.g., developer hours for coding an app).

## Importance
- **Control Development**: Metrics monitor progress (e.g., tracking KLOC growth).
- **Ensure Quality**: Quality metrics ensure reliability (e.g., low defect rates).

>**Example**: For an online store, metrics might show 5 KLOC, 50 function points for features, and 10 defects found during testing.

# Use Cases in Requirements

## Summary
Use cases describe how users interact with the system to achieve specific goals, providing a clear way to document functional requirements.

## What Are Use Cases?
A use case is a description of how a user (actor) interacts with the system to accomplish a goal (e.g., purchasing a product in an online store).
- **Components**:
  - **Actor**: The user or system interacting (e.g., customer, administrator).
  - **Goal**: The objective (e.g., complete a purchase).
  - **Steps**: Sequence of interactions (e.g., select product, add to cart, pay).
  - **Preconditions/Postconditions**: States before and after the use case (e.g., user must be logged in).

> **Example**: A use case for an e-commerce app:
  - **Actor**: Customer.
  - **Goal**: Purchase a product.
  - **Steps**: Browse products, add to cart, enter payment details, confirm order.
  - **Precondition**: User is registered and logged in.
  - **Postcondition**: Order is placed, and confirmation is sent.

## Role in SRS
- **Purpose**: Use cases translate functional requirements into actionable scenarios, making the SRS more concrete.
- **Benefits**:
  - Clarifies user interactions (e.g., how a customer searches for products).
  - Supports testing by defining expected behavior.
  - Reduces ambiguity by detailing steps.

>**Example**: An SRS for an Instagram-like app includes a use case for “post photo,” specifying steps like selecting an image, adding a caption, and publishing.

# Practical Notes for Requirements Engineering

## Summary
Effective requirements engineering ensures a robust SRS, aligning with software engineering principles and stakeholder needs.

## Best Practices
- **Use Elicitation Techniques**: Combine interviews, prototyping, and observation to capture all requirements (e.g., prototyping an e-commerce UI to clarify navigation needs).
- **Document Clearly**: Write requirements in clear, testable language (e.g., “search returns results in <5 seconds”).
- **Validate Early**: Check requirements for feasibility and clarity to avoid rework (e.g., ensuring payment integration is possible).
- **Use Standards**: Follow IEEE 830-1998 for SRS structure, as noted in prior SRS notes (artifact_id: b6bce7ca-65b2-48f0-bf80-9038d3d8f101).
- **Version Control**: Use Git to manage SRS revisions, aligning with your familiarity with development tools (June 19, 2025).

## Security Considerations
- Specify security requirements (e.g., HTTPS for data transmission, role-based access), per OWASP guidelines and your interest in secure coding (June 10, 2025).
- Include error-handling requirements to prevent data loss (e.g., handling failed logins).

## Integration with Development Models
- **Waterfall**: Finalize requirements upfront for a complete SRS.
- **Agile**: Update requirements per sprint, as seen in Instagram’s iterative feature additions (e.g., reels, stories).
- **Prototyping**: Use throw-away or evolutionary prototypes to refine requirements (e.g., testing an e-commerce cart prototype).
- **Spiral**: Incorporate risk analysis into requirements to mitigate issues (e.g., payment security risks).

## Metrics in Requirements
- Use metrics like function points to quantify requirements scope (e.g., 50 function points for an e-commerce app’s features).
- Track defects during validation to ensure quality (e.g., resolving ambiguous requirements).

## Example Application
For an Online Fashion Store (OFS):
- **Functional Requirements**: Browse products, add to cart, process payments.
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: 24/7 availability, secure transactions.
- **Use Case**: “Customer purchases a product” with steps like selecting an item, entering payment details, and receiving confirmation.
- **Elicitation**: Use interviews with shoppers and prototyping for UI design.
- **Metrics**: Measure KLOC for development size and defect rates for quality.
