# UML Notes

## Introduction to UML

Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a standardized visual language for modeling software systems, providing blueprints to visualize design, structure, and behavior. It facilitates communication among teams and stakeholders, supporting the SDLC from requirements to deployment.

### What is UML?

* **Definition**: UML is a general-purpose modeling language that standardizes the visualization of a system’s design, similar to blueprints in engineering. It is not a programming language but a visual tool for design representation.
* **Purpose**: Defines a clear, concise way to model systems, focusing on structure, behavior, and interactions.
* **Example**: For an Online Fashion Store (OFS), UML diagrams model user interactions (e.g., checkout process) and system components (e.g., database, server).
* **Role in SDLC**: Used in design and analysis phases to translate SRS requirements into visual models, informed by feasibility studies and data collection.

### Importance

* **Team Collaboration**: Enables clear communication among developers, designers, and non-technical stakeholders (e.g., business analysts for an OFS).
* **Stakeholder Communication**: Helps non-programmers understand requirements and processes without code (e.g., showing OFS checkout flow to managers).
* **Time Efficiency**: Saves time by visualizing processes, user interactions, and system structure early, reducing rework.
* **Example**: A UML class diagram for an OFS clarifies relationships between products, carts, and payments, aiding development planning.

## Types of UML Diagrams

UML diagrams are categorized into structural and behavioral types, each serving specific purposes in modeling a system’s static structure or dynamic behavior.

### Structural UML Diagrams

* **Definition**: Represent the static structure of a system, focusing on components and their relationships.
* **Types**:

  * Class Diagram
  * Deployment Diagram
  * Package Diagram
  * Object Diagram
  * Component Diagram
* **Purpose**: Model the system’s architecture and organization (e.g., OFS components like database and UI).

### Behavioral UML Diagrams

* **Definition**: Depict the dynamic behavior of a system, focusing on interactions and processes.
* **Types**:

  * Use Case Diagram
  * Sequence Diagram
  * Activity Diagram
  * State Machine Diagram
* **Purpose**: Illustrate how the system behaves and interacts (e.g., OFS user checkout sequence).

## Structural UML Diagrams

### Class Diagram

* **Definition**: Depicts the static structure of a system by showing classes, their attributes, operations, and relationships.
* **Components**:

  * **Classes**: Entities with attributes (data) and operations (methods).
  * **Attributes**: Properties of a class (e.g., `productName: String`).
  * **Operations**: Services provided by a class (e.g., `addToCart(): Boolean`).
  * **Relationships**: Association, directed association, multiplicity, aggregation, composition, inheritance, realization.
* **Example**:

  ```
  +------------------+
  |     Product      |
  +------------------+
  | productName: String |
  | price: Double    |
  +------------------+
  | addToCart(): Boolean |
  +------------------+
         ^
         |
  +------------------+
  |     Clothing     |
  +------------------+
  | size: String     |
  +------------------+
  ```

### Deployment Diagram

* **Definition**: Shows the physical deployment of software on hardware.
* **Components**:

  * **Node**: Hardware resource (e.g., `<<device>>` Server).
  * **Artifact**: Deployed software (e.g., `<<artifact>> app.jar`).
* **Example**:

  ```
  +-----------------+
  | <<device>>      |
  | Server          |
  +-----------------+
  | <<artifact>>    |
  | app.jar         |
  +-----------------+
        |
        | [network]
        |
  +-----------------+
  | <<device>>      |
  | Client PC       |
  +-----------------+
  | <<artifact>>    |
  | browser.exe     |
  +-----------------+
  ```

## Behavioral UML Diagrams

### Use Case Diagram

* **Definition**: Shows how users interact with the system via use cases.
* **Components**:

  * **Actors**: Users/external systems.
  * **Use Cases**: Functionalities (e.g., "Place Order").
* **Example: Supermarket System**:

  ```
  +---------------------------------+
  |      Supermarket System         |
  |                                 |
  |   [Register Customer]           |
  |   [Record Purchase]             |
  |   [Award Prizes]                |
  +---------------------------------+
         |           |
  +------+           +------+
  | Customer |       | Staff  |
  +----------+       +--------+
  ```

### Sequence Diagram

* **Definition**: Shows object interactions over time.
* **Components**: Actors, lifelines, messages.
* **Example**:

  ```
  Customer        Cart       PaymentSystem
    |              |              |
    | addItem()---->|              |
    | checkout()--->| process()---->|
    |<----success---|<----confirm---|
  ```

### State Machine Diagram

* **Definition**: Shows states of an object and transitions between them.
* **Example**:

  ```
  [Pending] --Payment Received--> [Processing] --Shipped--> [Delivered]
  ```

## Practical Notes for UML

### Best Practices

* Align with requirements (e.g., use cases).
* Use appropriate diagram types.
* Keep diagrams simple.
* Use tools like Lucidchart.
* Apply version control.
* Validate against requirements.

### Security Considerations

* Model secure interactions.
* Avoid exposing sensitive data.

### SDLC Integration

* **Requirements**: Use case diagrams.
* **Feasibility**: Deployment diagrams.
* **Design**: Class and sequence diagrams.
* **Agile**: Diagrams evolve with sprints.

### Example Application (OFS)

* **Class Diagram**: Product, Cart, Payment.
* **Use Case**: Place Order, Manage Inventory.
* **Deployment**: Server with app.jar, client browser.exe.
* **Sequence**: Checkout flow.
* **State Machine**: Order lifecycle.
* **Outcome**: UML clarifies and aligns software design with goals.
