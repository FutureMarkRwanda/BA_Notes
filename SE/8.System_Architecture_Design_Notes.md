# System Architecture Design Notes

## Introduction to Software Architecture

Software architecture defines the high-level structure of a system, outlining components, their interactions, and deployment strategies. It serves as a blueprint to guide development, ensuring alignment with requirements and facilitating communication among stakeholders.

### What is Software Architecture?

* **Definition**: A blueprint detailing components, their interactions, and deployment, abstracting implementation details.
* **Purpose**: Clarifies software behavior, ensures scalability, and enables team collaboration.
* **Key Aspects**:

  * Defines responsibilities of components.
  * Specifies communication protocols.
  * Selects implementation tools.
* **Example**: OFS architecture includes UI, payment logic, and database on a cloud server.

### Architecture vs. Design Patterns

* **Architecture Patterns**:

  * High-level system structure (e.g., client-server).
  * Focus on organization and communication.
* **Design Patterns**:

  * Class-level implementation solutions (e.g., Singleton).
  * Focus on logic and reuse.
* **Example**: OFS uses client-server architecture and Factory pattern for product creation.

## Architectural Styles

Standardized patterns that impact scalability, efficiency, and flexibility.

### Monolithic Architecture

* **Definition**: All components in a single, tightly coupled unit.
* **Pros**:

  * Simplicity in development.
  * Fast inter-component communication.
* **Cons**:

  * Risky updates and full redeployment.
  * Single point of failure.
* **Example**: OFS combines all features in one Java application.

### Microservices Architecture

* **Definition**: Independent services communicating via APIs.
* **Pros**:

  * Technology flexibility per service.
  * Independent deployment and scalability.
* **Cons**:

  * Complex coordination and testing.
  * Potential latency and consistency issues.
* **Example**: OFS with services for inventory, payments, etc., hosted on AWS.

### Client-Server Architecture

* **Definition**: Clients request, servers respond over a network.
* **Pros**:

  * Modular and scalable.
* **Challenges**:

  * Network security and reliability.
* **Example**: OFS with browser clients and a Java backend.

## Factors Influencing Architectural Decisions

### Business Factors

* Budget, strategy, future integration, domain knowledge.
* **Example**: OFS chooses microservices to prepare for growth.

### Technical Factors

* Design patterns, technology stack evolution.
* **Example**: OFS uses Spring Boot and adapts to new frameworks.

### Project Factors

* Stakeholder vision, legacy systems, time to market.
* **Example**: OFS starts with client-server for faster deployment.

### Professional Factors

* Past experience, stakeholder analysis.
* **Example**: Architect leverages past e-commerce systems.

## Common Architectural Patterns

### Layered Architecture

* **Definition**: System organized into logical layers (UI, business, data).
* **Usage**: Ideal for enterprise apps and beginners.
* **Shortcomings**: Code complexity, tight coupling if not structured well.
* **Example**: OFS uses UI, business logic, and MySQL DB layers.

### Event-Driven Architecture

* **Definition**: Components triggered by events.
* **Topologies**: Mediator (orchestrates), Broker (chained).
* **Usage**: Real-time updates, UI actions.
* **Shortcomings**: Complex testing, error handling.
* **Example**: OFS real-time inventory updates after purchases.

### Model-View-Controller (MVC)

* **Definition**: Separates Model (logic), View (UI), Controller (input handling).
* **Purpose**: Maintainability, modularity.
* **Frameworks**: Spring MVC, Django.
* **Example**: OFS uses MVC for product catalog and order processing.
* **Example 2**: OFS uses MVC for product catalog and order processing.
```java
// Model
public class Order {
    private List<Item> items;
    public void addItem(Item item) { items.add(item); }
}
// Controller
@Controller
public class OrderController {
    @Autowired
    private Order order;
    @RequestMapping("/addItem")
    public String addToOrder(@RequestParam Item item) {
        order.addItem(item);
        return "orderView";
    }
}
// View (simplified)
// orderView.html displays order.items
```

## Practical Notes for System Architecture Design

### Best Practices

* Align with system requirements.
* Use UML diagrams for visualization.
* Select architecture style per project needs.
* Plan for scalability and security.
* Version control documentation.
* Validate design against goals.

### Example Application (OFS)

* **Architecture**: Client-server + MVC.
* **Components**: Browser client, Java Spring Boot server, MySQL DB.
* **UML**: Deployment (AWS EC2), Sequence (checkout flow).
* **Physical Design**: Elastic cloud scaling.
* **Coding**: Java, structured via MVC.
* **Outcome**: A scalable, maintainable OFS aligned with secure practices.
