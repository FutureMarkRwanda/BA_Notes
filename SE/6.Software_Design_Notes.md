**Introduction to Software Design**

Software design is the disciplined process of translating software requirements into a blueprint for implementation. It bridges the gap between the "what" of user needs and the "how" of technical realization, ensuring a structured and maintainable development process.

**What is Software Design?**

* **Definition**: The process of converting the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) into detailed representations that guide coding.
* **Purpose**: To avoid chaotic development by providing structure—akin to having architectural plans before constructing a building.
* **Example**: In an Online Fashion Store (OFS), software design defines the system structure for user search, cart management, and checkout.

**Objectives**

* Ensure **correctness**, **efficiency**, and **understandability** of the system.
* Provide **completeness** and **maintainability** for long-term adaptability.

**Importance**

* Serves as the **foundation** for development.
* Promotes **modularity** for scalability.
* Enhances **traceability** from design back to user requirements.

## **Phases of Software Design**

**Architectural Design**

* High-level system view.
* Defines core components and their interactions.
* Output includes system architecture diagrams.

**High-Level Design**

* Breaks down the architecture into subsystems.
* Focuses on data flow and module interactions.
* Output includes data flow diagrams (DFD) and module hierarchies.

**Detailed Design**

* Specifies internal logic, algorithms, and data structures.
* Output includes pseudo-code, interface definitions, and class diagrams.

## **SOLID Principles**

### **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

* One class = one job.
* Promotes separation of concerns.

### **Open-Closed Principle (OCP)**

* Extendable without modifying existing code.
* Achieved using interfaces and inheritance.

### **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**

* Subtypes must be usable in place of supertypes.

### **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**

* Prefer multiple specific interfaces over a single general-purpose one.

### **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

* High-level modules should rely on abstractions, not concrete implementations.

---

## **Other Design Principles**

### **DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)**

* Eliminate code duplication.

### **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**

* Prefer simple, readable solutions.

### **YAGNI (You Aren’t Gonna Need It)**

* Only implement features when necessary.

---

## **Coupling and Cohesion**

### **Cohesion**

* Measures internal focus of a module.
* High cohesion = better readability and reusability.
* Types: Coincidental, Logical, Temporal, Procedural, Communicational, Sequential, Functional.

### **Coupling**

* Measures interdependence between modules.
* Low coupling = higher maintainability.
* Types: Content, Common, External, Control, Stamp, Data.

### **Benefits**

* High cohesion and low coupling lead to modular, testable, and maintainable systems.

## **Design Verification**

### **Process**

* Validate the design through reviews and formal methods.

### **Importance**

* Prevents costly errors during implementation.
* Ensures completeness and alignment with requirements.

---

## **Best Practices in Software Design**

* Apply SOLID, DRY, KISS, and YAGNI principles consistently.
* Use UML and design documentation to communicate ideas.
* Review and refine designs iteratively.

### **Security Considerations**

* Incorporate security at the design stage (e.g., encrypted communications, input validation).

## **Example: Online Fashion Store**

* **Architectural Design**: Define client, backend, and database.
* **High-Level Design**: Include modules for search, cart, checkout.
* **Detailed Design**: Specify classes and methods (e.g., `addToCart()`).
* Apply SOLID principles and verify design with stakeholders before implementation.
