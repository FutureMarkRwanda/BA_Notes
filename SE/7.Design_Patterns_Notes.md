# Design Patterns

## Introduction to Design Patterns

**Design patterns** are reusable solutions to common software design problems. They are high-level strategies that help developers tackle recurring issues in system architecture, object relationships, and class structures. Design patterns are not finished code but templates that must be adapted to specific problems.

### What are Design Patterns?

* **Definition**: General, reusable solutions to frequently occurring problems in software design.
* **Characteristics**:

  * Not specific code but adaptable concepts.
  * Based on object-oriented design principles.
  * Promote modularity, flexibility, and scalability.
  * Provide a shared vocabulary for developers (e.g., "Use a Singleton").
* **Example**: In an Online Fashion Store (OFS), a Singleton ensures only one database connection instance is used to manage resources efficiently.

### Benefits

* **Reusability**: Solutions are tested and widely adopted.
* **Consistency**: Encourages standardized design across teams.
* **Maintainability**: Patterns support clean and modular code.
* **Improved Communication**: Common terminology aids collaboration.
* **Adaptability**: Easier to scale or extend the system.

## Types of Design Patterns

Design patterns are grouped into three major categories:

### 1. Creational Patterns

* Focus on object creation mechanisms.
* Help control object instantiation.
* Examples: Singleton, Abstract Factory, Factory Method, Prototype

### 2. Structural Patterns

* Concerned with object composition and structure.
* Help ensure flexible relationships between classes.
* Examples: Adapter, Bridge, Composite

### 3. Behavioral Patterns

* Focus on communication between objects.
* Help define patterns of interaction.
* Examples: Chain of Responsibility, Command, Visitor

## Creational Patterns

### Singleton Pattern

* **Purpose**: Ensure a class has only one instance.
* **Use Case**: Single shared resource (e.g., database connection).
* **Java Example**:

```java
public class DatabaseConnection {
    private static DatabaseConnection instance;
    private DatabaseConnection() {}
    public static DatabaseConnection getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new DatabaseConnection();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

### Abstract Factory Pattern

* **Purpose**: Create families of related objects without specifying exact classes.
* **Use Case**: UI components for different platforms.

```java
interface UIFactory {
    Button createButton();
    TextField createTextField();
}
```

### Factory Method Pattern

* **Purpose**: Define an interface for creating objects; let subclasses decide the class to instantiate.
* **Use Case**: Create different product types.

```java
abstract class ProductCreator {
    abstract Product createProduct();
}
```

### Prototype Pattern

* **Purpose**: Clone existing objects efficiently.
* **Use Case**: Copy templates or prototypes.

```java
interface Prototype {
    Prototype clone();
}
```

## Structural Patterns

### Adapter Pattern

* **Purpose**: Convert one interface to another expected by the client.
* **Use Case**: Integrating legacy systems.

```java
class PaymentAdapter implements NewPaymentSystem {
    private LegacyPaymentSystem legacy;
    public void processPayment(String amount) {
        legacy.makePayment(Double.parseDouble(amount));
    }
}
```

### Bridge Pattern

* **Purpose**: Separate abstraction from implementation.
* **Use Case**: Different platforms rendering same abstractions.

```java
abstract class Page {
    protected Renderer renderer;
    abstract void display();
}
```

### Composite Pattern

* **Purpose**: Treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.
* **Use Case**: Represent tree-like structures (e.g., product categories).

```java
class Category implements CategoryComponent {
    List<CategoryComponent> components = new ArrayList<>();
}
```

---

## Behavioral Patterns

### Chain of Responsibility Pattern

* **Purpose**: Pass a request along a chain of handlers.
* **Use Case**: Escalating customer support requests.

```java
abstract class SupportHandler {
    protected SupportHandler next;
    abstract void handleRequest(String issue);
}
```

### Command Pattern

* **Purpose**: Encapsulate actions as objects, supporting undo and queue operations.
* **Use Case**: Undoable actions like adding/removing items.

```java
interface Command {
    void execute();
    void undo();
}
```

### Visitor Pattern

* **Purpose**: Separate operations from object structures.
* **Use Case**: Report generation over structured data.

```java
interface Visitor {
    void visit(Product product);
}
```

## Best Practices and Practical Notes

### Best Practices

* Use patterns when solving recurring problems.
* Don’t overuse them—simplicity is key.
* Document usage for team reference.
* Favor composition over inheritance.

### Security Considerations

* Ensure thread-safety for Singleton.
* Protect sensitive data when using behavioral patterns (e.g., Command).

### Example Application: Online Fashion Store

* **Singleton**: One instance of logging or DB connection.
* **Factory**: Create different product types dynamically.
* **Adapter**: Bridge old payment system with new interfaces.
* **Composite**: Handle hierarchical categories.
* **Command**: Support undo for cart actions.
* **Visitor**: Generate diverse reports from product objects.

Design patterns are powerful tools for writing clean, scalable, and maintainable code. Mastery of these patterns equips developers with versatile solutions and strong design intuition.
