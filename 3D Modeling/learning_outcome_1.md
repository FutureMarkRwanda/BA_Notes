## Objective

By the end of this section, learners will be able to:
- Define the purpose and intended message of a 3D concept.
- Outline detailed requirements for 3D models.
- Develop a 3D concept based on purpose and model details.
- Sketch and dimension conceptual 3D model designs.

## 1. **Introduction to 3D Concepts**

### 1.1 Definition
A 3D concept is a preliminary plan or idea for creating a three-dimensional model, defining its purpose, target audience, and design details to convey a specific message or story.

### 1.2 Example: Defining Purpose
For a 3D model of a prosthetic arm (as in the integrated situation):
- **Purpose**: Create a lightweight, flexible prosthetic arm.
- **Message**: Enhance user mobility and comfort.
- **Target Audience**: Medical professionals and amputees.

## 2. **Types of 3D Models**

### 2.1 Definition
3D models are digital representations of objects in three dimensions, categorized by structure.

### 2.2 Types
| Type        | Description                              | Example Use                |
|-------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Solids      | Solid geometry with volume               | Mechanical parts           |
| Meshes      | Surfaces made of polygons                | Game characters            |
| Point Clouds| Collection of data points in 3D space    | Scanned real-world objects |

## 3. **Importance of Analyzing 3D Concepts**

### 3.1 Definition
Analyzing 3D concepts ensures alignment with project goals, identifying needs, benefits, and aesthetic considerations.

### 3.2 Example: Analysis for Prosthetic Arm
- **Benefits**: Improved functionality and aesthetics.
- **Needs**: Lightweight materials, ergonomic design.
- **Aesthetics**: Smooth, natural appearance.

---

## 4. **Outlining Model Details**

### 4.1 Definition
Specifying requirements like dimensions, design principles, and stylistic choices for the 3D model.

### 4.2 Example: Model Details
- **Requirements**: Prosthetic arm must be 30 cm long, flexible joints.
- **Design Principles**: Ergonomics, durability.
- **Stylistic Choices**: Modern, sleek look.

## 5. **3D Concept Development**

### 5.1 Definition
The process of creating a 3D concept using software/tools, considering compatibility and modularity.

### 5.2 Example: Tools Selection
```plaintext
Software: Blender
Reason: Open-source, supports mesh modeling, compatible with Windows.
```

### 5.3 Modeling Stages
| Stage         | Description                        |
|---------------|------------------------------------|
| Skeleton      | Basic structure or wireframe       |
| Rigging       | Adding joints for animation        |
| Animation     | Defining movements                 |
| Rendering     | Producing final visual output      |

## 6. **Sketching Conceptual Design**

### 6.1 Definition
Creating initial drafts and dimensioned sketches to visualize the 3D model.

### 6.2 Example: Sketching in Blender
```plaintext
1. Open Blender.
2. Create a basic arm mesh using cube primitives.
3. Dimension: Set length to 30 cm using scale tool.
4. Export sketch as wireframe for review.
```
