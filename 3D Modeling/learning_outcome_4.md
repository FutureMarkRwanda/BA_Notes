## 1. **3D Printer Selection**

### 1.1 Definition
Choosing a 3D printer based on technology, accuracy, and material needs.

### 1.2 Example: Printer Choice
- **Printer**: Creality Ender 3 (FDM).
- **Reason**: Affordable, supports PLA for prosthetic arm.

### 1.3 Technologies
| Technology    | Description                              |
|---------------|------------------------------------------|
| FDM (FFF)     | Extrudes melted filament                 |
| SLA           | Cures resin with laser                   |
| SLS           | Fuses powder with laser                  |

## 2. **Printing Materials**

### 2.1 Definition
Materials like thermoplastics or resins used in 3D printing.

### 2.2 Example: Material Selection
- **Material**: PLA filament.
- **Properties**: Biodegradable, suitable for prosthetics.

## 3. **Slicing 3D Model**

### 3.1 Definition
Converting a 3D model into 2D layers (G-code) for printing.

### 3.2 Example: Slicing in Ultimaker Cura
```plaintext
1. Import prosthetic arm STL file.
2. Set layer height: 0.2 mm.
3. Generate supports for overhanging joints.
4. Export G-code to printer.
```

### 3.3 Slicer Software
| Software         | Features                              |
|------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Ultimaker Cura   | User-friendly, supports multiple printers |
| PrusaSlicer      | Optimized for Prusa printers          |
| Simplify3D       | Advanced customization                |

## 4. **3D Printer Setup**

### 4.1 Definition
Configuring printer settings like bed leveling and nozzle temperature.

### 4.2 Example: Setup for Ender 3
```plaintext
1. Level print bed using manual screws.
2. Set nozzle temperature: 200Â°C for PLA.
3. Load filament and test extrusion.
```

---

## 5. **Post-Processing**

### 5.1 Definition
Finishing printed objects through sanding, painting, or testing.

### 5.2 Example: Post-Processing Prosthetic Arm
```plaintext
1. Sand rough edges with 200-grit sandpaper.
2. Apply primer and paint for smooth finish.
3. Test joint flexibility.
```
