# Blockchain Platforms Notes


## Summary

Blockchain platforms are the foundational infrastructure for deploying decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and tokens. Each platform has its trade-offs in scalability, security, decentralization, and developer experience.

These platforms power key components of Web3—including NFT marketplaces, DeFi apps, DAOs, and supply chain systems—such as an **Online Fashion Store (OFS)**.

---

## 1. Ethereum

Ethereum is the **pioneer** in smart contract platforms and remains the most widely used for dApp development.

* **Key Features**:

  * **EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)** for contract execution
  * Transitioned from **Proof of Work (PoW)** to **Proof of Stake (PoS)** (Ethereum 2.0)
  * Rich ecosystem of tools (Remix, Truffle, Hardhat), wallets (MetaMask), and standards (ERC-20, ERC-721)

* **Use Case**:
  Deploying **OFS NFT Marketplace**, where each fashion item is an ERC-721 token, ensuring transparency and trust.

---

## 2. Solana

High-performance Layer 1 blockchain focusing on **speed and scalability**.

* **Key Features**:

  * **Proof of History (PoH)** + Proof of Stake consensus
  * Transaction throughput of over 50,000 TPS
  * Low transaction fees

* **Use Case**:
  OFS implements a **real-time auction system** for exclusive digital outfits.

---

## 3. Polygon (formerly Matic)

Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that reduces gas costs and speeds up transactions.

* **Key Features**:

  * EVM-compatible
  * Bridges to Ethereum
  * Supports zk-rollups, optimistic rollups, and sidechains

* **Use Case**:
  OFS leverages **Polygon** for **cost-effective micropayments** and NFT minting at scale.

---

## 4. Binance Smart Chain (BSC)

EVM-compatible blockchain developed by Binance with a focus on speed and low cost.

* **Key Features**:

  * Runs parallel with Binance Chain
  * Uses Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA)
  * Popular for DeFi and token trading

* **Use Case**:
  OFS launches a **DeFi loyalty program** where users stake tokens for discounts or early access to products.

---

## 5. Avalanche

A Layer 1 platform known for **high throughput** and **custom blockchain networks (subnets)**.

* **Key Features**:

  * 4,500 TPS with sub-second finality
  * Subnet support (custom virtual machines)
  * Low fees

* **Use Case**:
  OFS builds a **dedicated subnet** for internal supply chain tracking, isolating performance from public chains.

---

## 6. Polkadot

A multi-chain platform enabling different blockchains to operate together (interoperability).

* **Key Features**:

  * **Relay Chain** + **Parachains**
  * On-chain governance
  * Shared security model

* **Use Case**:
  OFS issues **cross-chain NFTs**, allowing users to move digital clothing between different blockchains.

---

## 7. Near Protocol

A **sharded, developer-friendly Layer 1 blockchain** focused on user and developer experience.

* **Key Features**:

  * High scalability via **Nightshade sharding**
  * Simple account model with human-readable names
  * Fast finality and low fees

* **Use Case**:
  OFS adopts NEAR for **new user onboarding** with **social logins and low gas fees**, improving UX.

---

## 8. Arbitrum & Optimism

Layer 2 rollup solutions that scale Ethereum while preserving its security.

* **Key Features**:

  * Use **Optimistic Rollups** for batching transactions off-chain
  * Faster and cheaper than Layer 1 Ethereum
  * Fully EVM-compatible

* **Use Case**:
  OFS hosts **high-traffic seasonal promotions** (e.g., flash sales) on **Arbitrum** to minimize gas fees and ensure fast execution.
