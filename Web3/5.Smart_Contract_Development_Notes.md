# Smart Contract Development



## Summary

Smart contracts are self-executing code deployed on blockchain networks. They automatically enforce rules, verify conditions, and execute outcomes without third-party intervention. Smart contracts are crucial for Web3 applications like DeFi platforms, NFT marketplaces, and decentralized e-commerce platforms such as an **Online Fashion Store (OFS)**.

This topic covers:

* Smart contract programming with **Solidity**
* Security best practices and known vulnerabilities
* Overview of alternative smart contract languages

## Solidity Programming Language

**Solidity** is the most widely used language for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

### Key Features of Solidity

* **Syntax & Structure**:

  * Similar to JavaScript/C++
  * Strongly typed, supports inheritance and interfaces
  * Code is grouped into `contracts`

* **State Variables**:

  * Store contract data on the blockchain
  * Declared with keywords like `public`, `private`, or `internal`

  ```solidity
  uint public totalProducts;
  address owner;
  ```

* **Functions**:

  * Define contract behavior (e.g., buying a product)
  * Visibility: `public`, `private`, `external`, `internal`
  * Special types: `view`, `pure`, `payable`

  ```solidity
  function addProduct(string memory name) public {
      totalProducts++;
      emit ProductAdded(name);
  }
  ```

* **Modifiers**:

  * Reusable code for conditions (e.g., access control)

  ```solidity
  modifier onlyOwner() {
      require(msg.sender == owner, "Not authorized");
      _;
  }
  ```

* **Events**:

  * Allow contracts to log data on the blockchain
  * Useful for frontend apps and debugging

  ```solidity
  event ProductAdded(string name);
  ```

* **Inheritance & Interfaces**:

  * Reuse and modularize code across multiple contracts
  * Interfaces allow defining external contract structures

  ```solidity
  contract Clothing is FashionItem {}
  interface IERC20 { function transfer(address, uint) external returns (bool); }
  ```

## Smart Contract Security

Smart contracts are immutable and handle real value—**security** is critical. Developers must be aware of common vulnerabilities and apply best practices.

### Common Vulnerabilities

* **Reentrancy Attacks**:

  * Occur when external calls re-enter the contract before the first call finishes
  * Mitigation: Use `Checks-Effects-Interactions` pattern and `ReentrancyGuard`

* **Integer Overflows/Underflows**:

  * Arithmetic operations exceeding max/min limits of variable types
  * Mitigation: Use `SafeMath` (now built-in in Solidity ≥0.8)

* **Front-running**:

  * When attackers exploit transaction ordering to benefit before a transaction is mined
  * Mitigation: Add commit-reveal schemes or minimal slippage in trades

* **Denial-of-Service (DoS)**:

  * Attackers block contract logic by exceeding gas limits or abusing loops
  * Mitigation: Avoid unbounded loops and verify all user inputs

### OFS Example:

* Prevent front-running of limited edition NFT mints
* Use access control modifiers to restrict admin-only functions
* Log events for transparency and debugging (e.g., when a fashion item is purchased)

## Other Smart Contract Languages

While Solidity dominates Ethereum development, alternative languages support various platforms or development styles.

### 1. **Vyper**

* **Python-like syntax**, simpler and more secure by design
* Lacks inheritance and function overloading
* Designed for high-security smart contracts on Ethereum

```python
owner: public(address)

@external
def __init__():
    self.owner = msg.sender
```

### 2. **Rust**

* Used for **Solana**, **Polkadot**, **Near**, and other non-EVM blockchains
* Compiled to WebAssembly (Wasm)
* Strong memory safety, fast execution, and concurrency support

```rust
#[program]
pub mod my_solana_program {
    pub fn mint_nft(ctx: Context<MintNFT>, uri: String) -> Result<()> {
        // Mint logic here
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

### 3. Others

* **Move** – Diem, Aptos (resource-oriented programming)
* **Cairo** – StarkNet ZK-Rollups
* **Go, JavaScript** – For blockchain clients and dApps

## Notes

* **Role in Web3**: Automate trust and enforce rules transparently and efficiently
* **OFS Application**:

  * Smart contracts for NFT fashion items (mint, transfer, burn)
  * Governance tokens for community voting on new collections
  * Royalty contracts for designers with event logging
