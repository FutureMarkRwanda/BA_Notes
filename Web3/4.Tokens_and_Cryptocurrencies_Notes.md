# Tokens and Cryptocurrencies

## Summary

Tokens and cryptocurrencies are essential components of blockchain ecosystems. They represent digital assets or rights and enable the decentralized exchange of value, governance, and access to services. These digital assets are critical in Web3 platforms such as an Online Fashion Store (OFS), where they facilitate payments, ownership, incentives, and community participation.

* Types and characteristics of fungible and non-fungible tokens
* Real-world and blockchain use cases
* ERC standards and tokenomics

## Coins vs. Tokens

Coins and tokens are both digital assets, but they serve different roles and operate on different infrastructures.

* **Coins**:

  * Native to their own blockchains (e.g., Bitcoin on Bitcoin blockchain, Ether on Ethereum).
  * Serve as a store of value and medium of exchange.
  * Used to pay transaction fees or reward validators.
  * Example: Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), Monero (XMR)

* **Tokens**:

  * Built on existing blockchains using smart contracts.
  * Represent various digital or real-world assets, access rights, or utility within applications.
  * Example: ERC-20 tokens like USDT (Tether), ERC-721 NFTs like a digital fashion item on OFS.

## Types of Tokens

Tokens are broadly classified into **fungible** and **non-fungible** tokens, based on whether or not they are interchangeable.

### Fungible Tokens

Fungible tokens are interchangeable, meaning each unit is identical in value and function.

* **Key Characteristics**:

  * **Interchangeability**: Any token of the same type can replace another.
  * **Divisibility**: Can be split into smaller units (e.g., 0.0001 BTC).
  * **Uniformity**: All tokens have the same properties and value.
  * **Liquidity**: Easily tradable across exchanges.
  * **Common Use**: Widely used in payments, governance, and trading.

* **Examples**:

  * OFS utility token for payments and discounts
  * Stablecoins (e.g., USDC) for stable-value transfers
  * Governance tokens for community decisions in DAOs

### Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)

Non-fungible tokens are unique digital assets that represent ownership or proof of authenticity for specific items.

* **Key Characteristics**:

  * Unique and not interchangeable
  * Indivisible (can’t be split like a currency)
  * Each NFT contains metadata and attributes that distinguish it

* **Examples**:

  * OFS digital clothing items, uniquely owned and tradeable
  * Digital art, music, in-game assets, virtual real estate

## Use Cases

### Use Cases of Fungible Tokens

* **Cryptocurrencies**: Bitcoin and Ethereum used for payments and store of value
* **Smart Contracts**: Automation of agreements using programmable tokens
* **Stablecoins**: Pegged to fiat for low-volatility transactions
* **Loyalty Points**: Rewards in online platforms like OFS
* **Tokenized Assets**: Representation of real estate, commodities, stocks

### Use Cases of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)

* **Digital Art**: Verifiable ownership of artwork
* **Collectibles**: Rare digital cards, virtual pets
* **Gaming**: In-game items and characters with true ownership
* **Virtual Real Estate**: Ownership of land in virtual worlds
* **OFS Example**: NFT-based exclusive designer clothing or membership passes

## How NFTs Work

NFTs are minted through smart contracts that record their metadata, assign ownership, and manage transfers.

* **Minting Process**:

  * A unique token is created and stored on a blockchain
  * Validators confirm and add the token to the ledger
  * Smart contracts ensure that ownership and transfers are secure and automated

* **Example**:

  * When a user purchases a digital jacket on OFS, a unique ERC-721 token is minted, proving their ownership.

## ERC Token Standards

Ethereum token standards (ERC – Ethereum Request for Comments) define the rules that tokens must follow to be compatible with the Ethereum ecosystem.

* **ERC-20**:

  * Standard for fungible tokens
  * Used for currencies, utility tokens, etc.
  * Example: OFS Token for store payments

* **ERC-721**:

  * Standard for NFTs (non-fungible tokens)
  * Each token has unique properties
  * Example: OFS digital clothing NFTs

* **ERC-1155**:

  * Hybrid standard supporting both fungible and non-fungible tokens
  * Efficient for games and batch transfers
  * Example: OFS bundle of accessories (some fungible, some unique)

* **Other Standards**:

  * **ERC-777**: Advanced token interactions
  * **ERC-4626**: Tokenized vaults

## Tokenization

**Tokenization** is the process of converting real-world or digital assets into blockchain tokens.

* **Purpose**:

  * Improve efficiency, transparency, and accessibility
  * Enable fractional ownership of physical assets

* **Examples**:

  * A piece of real estate represented as 1,000 tokens
  * An OFS membership card tokenized for resale or transfer

* **Historical Note**:

  * The concept of tokenization predates blockchain, e.g., casino chips, or early digital tokens used to secure credit card data

---

## Tokenomics

Tokenomics refers to the design and economic model of tokens to ensure utility, adoption, and sustainability.

* **Key Components**:

  * **Total Supply**: Fixed or inflationary
  * **Distribution**: ICOs, airdrops, team allocations
  * **Utility**: Payments, governance, access
  * **Incentives**: Staking rewards, loyalty bonuses

* **Example**:

  * OFS issues 1 million tokens:

    * 30% for user rewards
    * 20% for developers
    * 50% sold to early investors

---

## Notes

* **Role in Web3**: Tokens are building blocks for decentralized finance, marketplaces, and governance.
* **OFS Application**:

  * Fungible tokens for loyalty and payment systems
  * NFTs for digital fashion products and access rights
  * Governance tokens for involving the OFS community in business decisions
