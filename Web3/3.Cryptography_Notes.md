# Cryptography

## Description

Cryptography is the practice of securing information through encoding techniques that protect data from unauthorized access or manipulation. In the Web3 ecosystem, cryptography is essential for ensuring **confidentiality**, **data integrity**, and **authentication**. It underlies core blockchain functions such as transaction verification, wallet ownership, and smart contract execution.

In an Online Fashion Store (OFS) running on Web3, cryptography secures customer identities, validates payments, protects digital clothing items (as NFTs), and ensures the integrity of all transaction data recorded on-chain.

## Hashing

Hashing is a cryptographic process that converts any input data into a fixed-length string, known as a hash. The output is unique to the input, so even a small change in the data results in a significantly different hash. Hashing is deterministic (same input always gives same output), fast to compute, and irreversible (original data cannot be recovered from the hash).

In blockchain, hashing ensures data integrity. Each block contains the hash of the previous block, forming a secure and tamper-evident chain. Hashing also verifies files, transactions, and smart contract code.

An OFS might hash product IDs or transaction data to verify that they haven’t been altered. For example, when a user purchases an NFT-based outfit, the transaction data can be hashed and stored on Ethereum, ensuring that any later tampering would be easily detectable.

Common hash algorithms:

* **SHA-256**: Used in Bitcoin for hashing block headers and transactions.
* **Keccak-256 (SHA-3)**: Used in Ethereum for address and function signature generation.

| Algorithm  | Used In  | Output Size | Purpose                              |
| ---------- | -------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| SHA-256    | Bitcoin  | 256 bits    | Proof-of-work, block linking         |
| Keccak-256 | Ethereum | 256 bits    | Address creation, function selectors |

## Public-Private Key Pairs

Public-key cryptography, also known as **asymmetric encryption**, uses a pair of keys: a **public key** that can be shared openly, and a **private key** that must be kept secret. These keys are mathematically linked.

In Web3, public-private key pairs are used for secure authentication and digital asset management. A user's public key acts as their address on the blockchain, while their private key allows them to prove ownership and sign transactions.

Within OFS, each customer has a wallet address (public key) and a corresponding private key. When a customer makes a purchase, the private key is used to sign the transaction. This ensures that only the wallet’s owner can authorize transfers, and others can verify it using the public key.

This system ensures:

* Only authorized users can initiate actions
* Others can verify authenticity without accessing the private key

| Key Type    | Purpose                         | Visibility        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Public Key  | Used as an address and verifier | Shared publicly   |
| Private Key | Used to sign transactions       | Kept confidential |

## Digital Signatures

A digital signature is a cryptographic method that validates the authenticity and integrity of a message or transaction. It is created by applying a user's private key to the hash of a message. The recipient (or network) can then verify the signature using the sender’s public key.

In blockchain, digital signatures are required to approve transactions. They confirm that the sender is the rightful owner of the account and that the message has not been tampered with.

In an OFS use case, when a buyer purchases an NFT outfit, their private key signs the transaction. The Ethereum network uses their public key to verify the signature before confirming the transaction.

Here is a simplified code example in JavaScript (using Ethers.js):

```javascript
const { ethers } = require("ethers");

async function signTransaction(wallet, data) {
    const hash = ethers.utils.hashMessage(data);
    return await wallet.signMessage(hash);
}
```

This code takes a message, hashes it, and signs it using the user’s private key stored in the wallet. This process ensures transaction authenticity without revealing the private key.

| Step                   | Description                                        |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Create Hash            | Data to be signed is hashed                        |
| Sign with Private Key  | Hash is signed to generate the digital signature   |
| Verify with Public Key | Signature is checked by anyone with the public key |

## Applications

Cryptography enables secure and trustless interaction between users and decentralized applications. It is foundational to all security operations in Web3, including:

* Wallet management
* Transaction approval
* Smart contract deployment
* Verifying ownership of NFTs and digital assets

In the context of OFS:

* Hashing secures product data and transaction logs.
* Public-private key pairs manage customer accounts without usernames or passwords.
* Digital signatures confirm the authenticity of purchases and NFT transfers.

The combination of these cryptographic tools ensures that customers can trust the OFS platform to protect their digital clothing items, personal data, and funds.
