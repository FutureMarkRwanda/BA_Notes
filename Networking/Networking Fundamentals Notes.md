# Networking Fundamentals

## Communication Model
- **Definition**: The process of exchanging data between two devices via a transmission medium.
- **Types**:
  - **Local**: Uses LAN connections for short distances.
  - **Remote**: Uses MAN or WAN for long distances.
- **Data Format**: Transferred as binary (0s and 1s).

### **Characteristics**

  | Characteristic | Description |
  |---------------|-------------|
  | Delivery      | Data must reach the correct destination. |
  | Accuracy      | Data must be delivered without errors. |
  | Timeliness    | Data must arrive at the exact time. |
  | Jitter        | Variability in time delay between transmission and reception. |

### **Components**

  | Component | Role |
  |-----------|------|
  | Sender    | Device that sends data. |
  | Receiver  | Device that receives data. |
  | Medium    | Physical path for data transmission. |
  | Message   | Information being transmitted. |
  | Protocol  | Rules governing communication (syntax, semantics, timing). |


## Transmission Medium
- **Definition**: The physical or wireless path for data transmission between sender and receiver.
- **Types**:
  - **Guided Media (Wired)**: Signals follow a fixed physical path.
  - **Unguided Media (Wireless)**: Signals travel as electromagnetic waves.

### **Guided Media Types**

  | Type              | Description | Applications |
  |-------------------|-------------|--------------|
  | Twisted Pair Cable| Copper wires twisted in pairs; UTP (unshielded) or STP (shielded). | Telephone, Ethernet (e.g., CAT5 for Fast Ethernet). |
  | Coaxial Cable     | Central conductor with insulating sheath and outer shield. | Cable TV, traditional Ethernet LANs. |
  | Fiber Optic Cable | Glass/plastic core transmitting light signals. | Backbone networks, Fast Ethernet (100Base-FX), cable TV hybrids. |


#### **Twisted Pair Details**:
  - **UTP**: No metallic shield; small, flexible, but prone to interference.
  - **STP**: Insulated wires with shielding; reduces interference, faster speeds.
  - **ScTP (Screened Twisted Pair)**: UTP with foil shield; hybrid of UTP/STP.
  - **Advantages**: Cheaper, easy to splice, less interference, faster data rates.
  - **Disadvantages**: STP is larger, more expensive, harder to connect.
##### Cables and Connections
- **Types**:

  | Cable Type        | Description | Use Case |
  |-------------------|-------------|----------|
  | Straight-Through  | Same pin order on both ends; connects unlike devices (e.g., PC to switch). | Common Ethernet connections. |
  | Crossover         | T568A on one end, T568B on the other; connects like devices (e.g., PC to PC). | Direct device-to-device links. |

#### **Coaxial Cable Details**:
  - **Structure**: Central copper conductor, insulating sheath, outer shield, plastic cover.
  - **Types**:
    - **Thinnet**: Short-distance (max 185 m).
    - **Thicknet**: Long-distance (max 500 m).
  - **Advantages**: High bandwidth, noise immunity, easy to install, inexpensive.
  - **Disadvantages**: Single cable failure disrupts the network.
#### **Fiber Optic Cable Details**:
  - **Operation**: Transmits light signals; uses refraction/reflection based on angle of incidence.
  - **Types**:
  
    | Type       | Features | Use Case |
    |------------|----------|----------|
    | Multimode  | Multiple light paths; step-index (constant density) or graded-index (varying density). | Short distances; less distortion in graded-index. |
    | Single-Mode| Single light path; minimal distortion. | Long distances (up to 200 km). |
  

### **Unguided Media Examples**:
  - Mobile phones, satellite microwave, infrared.
### **Applications**: Backbone networks, Fast Ethernet, cable TV hybrids.

## Protocols and Standards
- **Protocol Definition**: Rules governing data communication (syntax, semantics, timing).
- **Key Elements**:
  - **Syntax**: Data structure/format (e.g., first 8 bits for sender address).
  - **Semantics**: Meaning of data bits (e.g., address as route or destination).
  - **Timing**: When and how fast data is sent (e.g., 100 Mbps).
### **Protocol Functions**:

  | Function                | Description |
  |-------------------------|-------------|
  | Encapsulation           | Adds control info (address, error code) to data in PDUs. |
  | Fragmentation/Reassembly| Breaks data into smaller blocks; reassembles at destination. |
  | Connection Control      | Manages connectionless (datagram) or connection-oriented (virtual circuit) transfers. |
  | Ordered Delivery        | Ensures PDUs arrive in sequence using numbering. |
  | Flow Control            | Limits data rate to prevent overflow (e.g., stop-and-wait, sliding window). |
  | Error Control           | Detects/corrects errors via codes and retransmission. |
  | Addressing              | Identifies sender/receiver. |
  | Multiplexing            | Combines multiple data streams. |
  | Transmission Services   | Supports additional features like prioritization. |
### **Common Protocols**:

  | Protocol   | Description | Layer |
  |------------|-------------|-------|
  | NetBEUI    | Fast, low-overhead LAN protocol for small networks (up to 200 stations). | Transport/Data Link |
  | TCP        | Reliable transport protocol; segments and controls data flow. | Transport |
  | IP         | Encapsulates packets, assigns addresses, routes data. | Network |
  | HTTP       | Governs web server-client interactions. | Application |

### **Standards**:
  - Ensure interoperability across vendors, promote competition, reduce costs.
  - **Types**:
    - **De Facto**: Widely used but not formally approved (e.g., Windows OS).
    - **De Jure**: Approved by standards bodies (e.g., ASCII, USB).
  - **Organizations**:
  
    | Organization | Role | Examples |
    |--------------|------|----------|
    | ISO          | International standards; defines OSI model. | OSI, ASCII |
    | IEEE         | Technical standards; 30% of electrical engineering literature. | 802.3 (Ethernet), 802.11 (Wi-Fi) |
    | ANSI         | U.S. standards; coordinates voluntary standardization. | T1, ANSI C/C++ |
    | ITU          | Global telecom standards; three sectors (ITU-R, ITU-T, ITU-D). | E1, V-series modems |
    | EIA          | U.S. electronics standards; defines serial interfaces. | RS-232, RS-422 |
    | Telcordia    | Predicts component failure rates for telecom. | Reliability models |

Here‚Äôs a **revised and improved** version of your networking notes with better structure, clarity, and consistency ‚Äî especially for learners and exam review. I've also added headings to help navigate the sections more easily and included slight technical clarifications where useful.
