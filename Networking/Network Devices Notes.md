# Network Devices

## Introduction to Computer Networks
- A computer network connects devices (nodes) to share resources like the Internet, printers, or file servers.
- Nodes include computers, phones, servers, and networking hardware.
- Connection types:
  - **Wired**: Uses cables (Ethernet, coaxial, fiber optic).
  - **Wireless**: Uses radio waves.
- Aim: Facilitate resource sharing among devices via communication channels.

## Components of Computer Networks
- Key components: NIC, Hub, Cables and Connectors, Router, Switch, Modem.

## Network Interface Card (NIC)
- **Purpose**: Enables communication between devices.
- **Types**:
  - **Wired NIC**: Uses cables for data transfer.
  - **Wireless NIC**: Uses radio waves via an antenna (common in laptops).
- **MAC Address**:
  - Unique identifier for network interfaces (e.g., 00:0a:95:9d:68:16).
  - Consists of:
    - **OUI**: Organizationally Unique Identifier.
    - **UAA**: Universally Administered Address.
  - Linked to the hardware of network adapters.

## Hub
- **Function**: Central device that splits a network connection to multiple devices.
- **Operation**: Broadcasts requests to all connected devices.
- **Types**:
  - **Active Hub**: Has power supply, cleans, boosts, and relays signals; extends node distance.
  - **Passive Hub**: Relays signals without boosting; powered by active hub.
  - **Intelligent Hub**: Like active hub but with remote management and flexible data rates.

## Switch
- **Function**: Connects devices and forwards data only to the intended recipient.
- **Advantage over Hub**: No broadcasting; direct source-to-destination communication.
- **Purpose**: Enhances network efficiency by reducing unnecessary traffic.

## Bridge
- **Function**: Connects multiple network segments to form a single network.
- **Operation**: Tracks devices on each segment and filters traffic to reduce congestion.
- **Purpose**: Divides LANs into segments for better performance.

## Access Point (AP)
- **Function**: Connects wireless devices to a wired network (WLAN).
- **Role**: Transmits/receives data and links WLAN to fixed networks.
- **Range**:
  - Indoors: ~98.4 ft (30 m).
  - Outdoors: Greater distances (depends on technology).

## Repeater
- **Function**: Extends network coverage by amplifying and retransmitting signals.
- **Use**: Overcomes weak signals or obstructions; services remote nodes.
- **Advantages**:
  - Simple installation.
  - Cost-effective.
  - Connects different cable types.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Cannot connect dissimilar networks.
  - Does not filter noise.
  - Cannot reduce traffic/congestion.
  - Limited number per network.

## Cables and Connectors
- **Types of Cables**:
  - **Twisted Pair**: High-speed (1Gbps+), cost-effective.
  - **Coaxial**: Higher cost, high-speed, resembles TV cable.
  - **Fiber Optic**: Uses light beams, fastest, most expensive (often government-level).
- **RJ45 Connector**:
  - Standard for Ethernet networking.
  - Connects telecommunications/data equipment.

## Router
- **Function**: Connects LAN to the Internet or links distinct networks.
- **Purpose**: Routes data between networks, enabling Internet access for multiple devices.

## Modem
- **Function**: Converts digital signals to analog (and vice versa) for Internet access via telephone, cable, or satellite.
- **Types**:
  - **Internal Modem**: Circuit board in motherboard slot.
  - **External Modem**: Separate unit connected via cables/USB.
- **Operation**:
  - **Modulation**: Converts analog to digital.
  - **Demodulation**: Converts digital to analog.

## Uses of Computer Networks
- **Resource Sharing**: Share programs, printers, data without physical location constraints.
- **Server-Client Model**: Central server stores data; clients access it remotely.
- **Communication Medium**: Enables email, video conferencing, etc.
- **E-commerce**: Supports online businesses (e.g., Amazon).

## Properties/Features of Computer Networks
- **Easy Resource Sharing**: Shares Internet, files, printers, etc.
- **Performance**: Measured by bandwidth and latency; depends on users, connectivity, and software.
- **Reliability**: Ensures data delivery with alternative communication paths if hardware fails.
- **Scalability**: Allows adding devices without degrading performance.
- **Security**: Protects data from unauthorized access.
- **Communication Speed**: Enables fast interactions (e.g., video conferencing, email).
- **File Sharing**: Simplifies data exchange between devices.
- **Backup and Rollback**: Easy due to centralized server storage.
- **Software/Hardware Sharing**: Centralized applications/hardware reduce costs.

## Advantages of Computer Networks
- Enhanced communication and information access (e.g., online content, apps).
- Resource sharing reduces costs (e.g., one printer for multiple users).
- Easy file sharing saves time (e.g., teacher sharing homework).
- Improved storage capacity for shared data.
- Cost efficiency via shared software licenses.
- Secure data access (users cannot view othersâ€™ files).
- Easy backups on centralized servers.

## Disadvantages of Computer Networks
- **Lack of Independence**: System downtime halts operations.
- **Security Issues**: Risks of viruses, hacking; requires antivirus/firewall.
- **Lack of Robustness**: Main server failure can disable the network.
